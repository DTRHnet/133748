DEPLOYMENT TRACKING LOG
======================

ISSUE: Netlify deployment failed due to:
1. cross-env not found (moved to dependencies - FIXED)
2. husky prepare script running in CI (added is-ci - FIXED)
3. Missing build:netlify script (created - FIXED)

PROBLEM: I accidentally removed all functionality from echoheist.js and replaced with mock data
SOLUTION: Restore full EchoHEIST functionality while keeping Netlify compatibility

CURRENT STATUS:
- Netlify build configuration: FIXED
- EchoHEIST functionality: RESTORED with full Puppeteer functionality
- Need to maintain both local functionality AND Netlify deployment

COMPLETED:
1. ✅ Restored full EchoHEIST functionality in netlify/functions/echoheist.js
2. ✅ Added Puppeteer with proper browser launch options for Netlify
3. ✅ Implemented network request interception to capture download URLs
4. ✅ Added proper error handling and logging
5. ✅ Maintained CORS headers for web interface compatibility

NEXT STEPS:
1. Test the Netlify function locally
2. Deploy to Netlify and test
3. Ensure search functionality also works
4. Verify end-to-end functionality
