# EchoHEIST Web App - Complete Implementation

## 🎸 Overview

I have successfully transformed the EchoHEIST script into a fully functional web application that provides a user-friendly interface for downloading Ultimate Guitar tabs. The web app maintains all the original functionality while adding real-time progress tracking and a modern web interface.

## ✨ Features Implemented

### 🌐 Web Interface

- **Modern, responsive design** with gradient backgrounds and clean typography
- **Real-time URL input** with validation for Ultimate Guitar URLs
- **Live progress tracking** via WebSocket connections
- **Verbose logging display** showing every step of the download process
- **Automatic file serving** once downloads complete

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

- **Express.js server** with Socket.IO for real-time communication
- **Puppeteer integration** for headless browser automation
- **Network request interception** to capture download links
- **File management** with automatic filename generation
- **Error handling** with comprehensive user feedback

### 📊 Real-time Features

- **Live status updates** showing connection status
- **Step-by-step logging** of the entire download process

- **Success/failure notifications** with detailed error messages

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Start the Web App

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Start the web application
npm run web
```

The web app will be available at: **http://localhost:3000**

### 2. Download a Tab

1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Paste an Ultimate Guitar tab URL (example: `https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/metallica/one-guitar-pro-54157`)
3. Click "Download Guitar Pro File"
4. Watch the real-time progress in the log window
5. Download the file when the process completes

## 🔍 What Happens Behind the Scenes

The web app provides **verbose output** showing exactly what's happening:

1. **URL Validation**: Checks if the URL is from ultimate-guitar.com
2. **Browser Launch**: Starts a headless Chrome browser
3. **Page Navigation**: Navigates to the Ultimate Guitar tab page
4. **Network Monitoring**: Intercepts all network requests
5. **Download Detection**: Captures the download request when it occurs
6. **File Download**: Executes curl command with proper headers
7. **File Serving**: Makes the downloaded file available for download

## 🎯 Verbose Output Example

When you use the web app, you'll see detailed logs like:

```
[12:34:56] 🚀 Starting download process for: https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/metallica/one-guitar-pro-54157
[12:34:57] Generated filename: metallica_one.gpx
[12:34:58] Launching browser...
[12:34:59] Browser launched successfully
[12:35:00] New page created
[12:35:01] Network interception enabled
[12:35:02] Navigating to: https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/metallica/one-guitar-pro-54157
[12:35:05] Page loaded, waiting for network activity...
[12:35:08] 🎯 Captured download request: https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/download/public/...
[12:35:09] Executing curl command...
[12:35:10] ✅ Successfully downloaded: metallica_one.gpx
[12:35:11] Browser closed
[12:35:12] 🎉 Download process completed successfully!
```

## 🔧 Configuration

The web app uses the same configuration system as the CLI tool. Key settings in `config/default.conf`:

- `tabs_dir`: Directory where downloaded files are saved
- `log_level`: Verbosity of logging output
- `request_timeout_ms`: Network request timeout
- `chrome_path`: Optional path to Chrome executable

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port 3000 in use**: Kill existing processes or change the PORT environment variable
2. **Chrome not found**: Ensure Chrome/Chromium is installed or set the `chrome_path` in config
3. **Download fails**: Verify the URL is a valid Ultimate Guitar Guitar Pro tab URL

### Getting Help

- Check the browser console for client-side errors
- Check the server console for backend errors
- Verify the URL format matches Ultimate Guitar tab URLs

## 🎉 Success!

The EchoHEIST web app is now fully functional and provides:

✅ **Web-based interface** for easy URL input  
✅ **Real-time progress tracking** with verbose output  
✅ **Automatic file serving** when downloads complete  
✅ **Modern, responsive design** that works on all devices  
✅ **Comprehensive error handling** with user-friendly messages  
✅ **Integration with existing codebase** maintaining all original functionality

The web app successfully transforms the command-line EchoHEIST script into an accessible, user-friendly web application while maintaining all the original functionality and adding enhanced real-time feedback.
