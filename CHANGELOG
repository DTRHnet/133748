# CHANGELOG


## 0.2.0-Alpha-0.5 (2025-05-28)
**Added**
  - Terminal User Interface (TUI) Filtering: Implemented a new feature to automatically omit search results from the TUI display if their URL does not contain 'guitar-pro'. This ensures the TUI focuses only on relevant Guitar Pro tabs.

**Improved**
  - CLI Argument Parsing: Enhanced argument handling to correctly pass --tui and other flags to the Node.js application, resolving "unknown cli config" warnings.
  - TUI Initialization: Implemented await app.waitUntilExit() to ensure the TUI remains active until explicitly exited by the user, preventing immediate process termination.

**Fixed**
  - Ink Rendering Error: Resolved "Text string ' ' must be rendered inside <Text> component" error by correctly wrapping all literal strings and whitespace within <Text> components in the TUI.
  - Search Script Execution: Adjusted package.json search script to directly call node dist/index.js, simplifying argument passing and avoiding issues with nested npm run commands.

**Refactored**
  - Search Result Grouping: Optimized the internal logic for grouping and structuring search results into a hierarchical format suitable for TUI display.

0.2-Alpha-0.4
**Added**
  - Terminal User Interface (TUI): Introduced an interactive TUI for navigating search results.
      -  Key bindings for intuitive navigation (Up/Down/Left/Right Arrows, Enter).
      -  Ability to expand and collapse tree nodes for hierarchical data.
      -  Dynamic sorting of results within the TUI (by Type, Artist, Song, and Tab Type).
      -  Functionality to toggle expansion/collapse for all nodes at the current depth ([a] key).
      -  Direct opening of Ultimate Guitar tab URLs in the default browser from the TUI.
  - Grab Feature: Added a grab command to download Guitar Pro tabs directly.
      - Can be used via node dist/index.js grab <URL>.
      - Integrated into the TUI for marking multiple links and downloading them one by one.

**Improved**
